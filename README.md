## Document Management System (API)

Document Management System provides a restful API for users to create and manage documents, giving different privileges based on user roles. Uses JWT for authentication. **Updated to comply with [json:api](https://jsonapi.org) specification.**

## API Documentation
The API has routes, each dedicated to a single task that uses HTTP response codes to indicate API status and errors.

#### API Features

The following features make up the Document Management System API:

##### Authentication

- It uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- It generates a token on successful login or account creation and returns it to the user
- It verifies the token to ensure a user is authenticated to access every endpoints

##### Users

- It allows users to be created
- It allows users to login and obtain a unique token which expires every 24hours
- It allows authenticated users to retrieve and update their information
- It allows users to retrieve and manage their documents
- It allows the admin to manage users

##### Documents

- It allows new documents to be created by authenticated users
- It ensures all documents are accessible based on the permission/priviledges
- It allows admin users to create, retrieve, modify, and delete documents
- It ensures users can retrieve, edit and delete documents that they own
- It allows users to retrieve all documents they own as well as public documents
- It allows users on the same role to retrieve role-based documents

### **Getting Started**
* Ensure you have `ruby` and `rails` installed or install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails)
* Clone the project repository from your terminal `git clone https://github.com/andela-moseni/dms-in-rails.git`
* Change directory into the `dms-in-rails` directory
* Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies in the `Gemfile`
* Run `rails db:setup` to create database, run migrations and seed data
* Run `rails s` to start the project
* Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or any API testing tool of your choice to access the endpoints
- For all endpoints that require authentication, use `Authorization: <token>`
- Add `Accept: application/vnd.api+json` and `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` to the headers as well

### Limitations:
The limitations to the **Document Management System API** are as follows:
* Users can only create plain textual documents and retrieve same when needed
* Users cannot share documents with people, but can make document `public` to make it available to other users
* Users login and obtain a token which is verified on every request, but users cannot logout (nullify the token), however tokens become invalid when it expires (after 24 hours)
